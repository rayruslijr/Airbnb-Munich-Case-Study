# Airbnb-Munich-Case-Study

For the final project of the data immersion course, I decided to conduct an analysis of Airbnb data in Munich. I utilized python with pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit, Pylab, and Folium Libraries for this project.

Munich is one of the most expensive cities in Germany. It is also one of the cities experiencing a housing crisis. To dampen the overheating housing market, the city council banned short-term rentals in Munich (since December 2017), which were blamed for being one of the contributors to the situation.

Bavaria's capital also received over 8 million tourists in 2019 and 3 million in 2020, making it one of Germany's most visited cities. There is a demand for Airbnb's type of business in this city.

In this case study, I will explore Airbnb's open data to produce some insight and KPIs into Airbnb's market in the city of Munich. 
The data sets contain information on Airbnb listings for Munich scraped from Airbnb in December 2021.
In the folders, you can find my code for:

- data wrangling,
-	consistency checks,
-	visual exploratory data analysis (EDA),
- creating geographical visualizations: a choropleth map,
- supervised machine learning: linear regression,
-	unsupervised machine learning: clustering,
-	time series analysis.

Time series analysis is not included in the final presentation, just as many results of the EDA. The final presentation concentrates on the analytical journey and critical results.

In this analysis, I answer questions such as:

•	What is the average price of an Airbnb Listing? And what sort of accommodation is available?
•	What factors influence the price of the listing?
•	which Munich neighborhoods are the most popular?
