# Airbnb-Munich-Case-Study

For this final project of the data immersion course I utilised python with pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit, pylab and folium libraries to conduct an analysis of Airbnb data in Munich.

Munich is one of the most expensive cities in the Germany, and it is also one of the cities where it experiences a housing crisis. To dampen the overheating housing market, the city council banned the short-term rental in the city of Munich (since December 2017), which were blamed to be one of the contributors of the situation.

The Bavaria’s capital also received over 8 million tourists in 2019 and 3 million in 2020, which makes it one of the most visited cities in Germany and there is a demand for Airbnb’s type of business in this city.

In this case study, I will explore the Airbnb’s open data to produce some insight and KPIs into the Airbnb’s market in the city of Munich. 
The data sets contain information on Airbnb listings for Munich scraped from Airbnb in December 2021.

In the folders you can find my code for:
•	data wrangling,
•	consistency checks,
•	visual exploratory data analysis (EDA),
•	creating geographical visualisations: a choropleth map,
•	supervised machine learning: linear regression,
•	unsupervised machine learning: clustering,
•	time series analysis.

Time series analysis is not included in the final presentation just as many results of the EDA. The final presentation concentrates on the analytical journey and key results.

In this analysis, I answer questions such as:
•	What is the average price of an Airbnb Listing? And what sort of accommodation is available?
•	What factors influence the price of the listing?
•	which Munich neighbourhoods are the most popular?
